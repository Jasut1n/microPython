<h1 align="center">Spotify web API for Micropython</h1>
<br />

<strong>This is a library for using Spotify's web API from a IoT device with Micropython.
It was developed and tested with an esp8266, but the library was made to work on any device
and with both Micropython and CPython 3.5+. It is far from feature complete but there is 
a pattern to follow when adding more of the API.</strong>

<br />
* spotify_web_api is the library
* main.py is the Seagulls! button example application
* boot.py is a template for setting up Wi-Fi
* wizard.py is a tool to set up the device
* spotify_web_api_micropython.bin is a Micropython v1.13 firmware for esp8266 with 
  the library frozen in it.
